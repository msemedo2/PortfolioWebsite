            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              MikeFlix is a web application, developed using the MERN stack, that provides users with access to
              information about
              movies, directors, and genres.
              <br>
              Users can create an account, update their personal information, and create a list of favorite movies.
            </p>

          <div class="project-text">
            <h3>Purpose & Context</h3>
            <p>
              MikeFlix was a personal project I built as part of my full-stack web development course at CareerFoundy,
              to
              demonstrate
              my mastery of JavaScript development.
              <br><br>
              With the vast supply of movies available for people to watch, it is often hard to know exactly what to
              watch.
              The number of streaming apps and websites can sometimes be a bit overwhelming when it comes time to decide
              on what to
              watch and often settling on a less-than-ideal show.

              <h3>Objective</h3>
              <p>
                The project aim was to have an ambitious full-stack project I could add to my professional portfolio.
                <br>
                The problem I wanted to solve was to build the complete server-side and client-side application from
                scratch.

              <h3>Duration</h3>
              <p>
                The development of the complete application took me around 2 months, though it took me longer to build
                the client-side,
                given it was my first interaction with React.

            <h3>Server Side</h3>
            <p>
              I created a RESTful API using Node.js and Express, that interacts with a non-relational database (MongoDB)
              which, given
              its flexibility, makes it a great choice for storing organic data with constantly changing requirements.
              <br><br>
              The API can be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST.

              To retrieve data from and store
              data in the
              database, CRUD methods are used. The API provides movie information in JSON format.
              <br>
              To test the API, I used Postman. I also included user authentication and authorization in the form of
              basic HTTP
              authentication and JWT authentication.

              <h3>Client Side</h3>
              <p>
                Once the server side was set up, I started to build the interface users would need when making requests
                to, and
                receiving responses from the server-side.
                <br><br>
                It is a single-page, responsive application developed with React and React-Redux. It provides several
                interface views,
                including, but not limited to, a main view (shows a list of all movies), a single movie view (shows data
                about a single
                movie and allows users to add the movie to their list of favorites), a login view, a registration view
                and a profile
                view (where users can update their user data and list of favorites).
                <br><br>
                Developing the client-side took me a while, to fully understand the flow of React Redux and how to
                manage the state of
                the application, but after those concepts were cleared, it was easy to see its effectiveness.

            <h3>Class VS Functional Components</h3>
            <p>
              In React everything consists of two types of components: class components and functional components.
              <br>
              For MikeFlix front-end, I utilized a mix of both types to practice both spectrums. In a real-world
              scenario, more
              consistency would be advisable.
              <br><br>
              With React latest versions, class components have taken a back seat to functional components.

              Deciding which component to use always devolves into a discussion of inheritance vs composition. Using
              functional
              components encourages composition, while class components lend themselves to inheritance design patterns.
              <br><br>
              Although I would opt in using functional components most of the time, React still supports class
              components for legacy
              purposes.

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>
              This was my most challenging and rewarding project to build. It taught me how to create an application
              from the ground
              up, both the front-end and back-end.
              I have enjoyed building the API and working with database structures.
              <br>
              At first, the concept of state and unidirectional data flow in React was hard to grasp but it eventually
              made sense.
              <br><br>
              React-Redux added a huge level of complexity. It allows a much more sophisticated way to share "state" 
              between
              components by storing them in a central "store". Figuring out how that works and how to refactor my app
              took me a while,
              but in the end, it all made a lot of sense and it became easy to see that when an application starts to
              get more complex
              the best option will be React's Context API or React Redux to avoid prop drilling.

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>MikeFlix was my first full-stack web application. Learning the ins and outs of React was one of the most
            fun experiences
            I had learning a new tool, and it just made me appreciate the thought put into it and the simplicity,
            structure, and
            reusability it gives your application.</p>

          <h3>Credits</h3>
          <p>My role was as lead developer, but I also have to point out the support and direction given by my mentor
            Mohamed and
            tutor Adam throughout the project.
            Both provided valuable insight into different ways to approach problems, and suggestions on how to
            structure
            the site.</p>
